This program checks if two strings are Anagram or not in Java.

Two strings are said to be Anagrams if they make a meaningful word by rearranging or shuffling the letters of the string.

Example 1 -

- Input => String s1 = "name" , String s2 = "mean"

- Output => It's an Anagram i.e both the strings have same letters just arranged differently.

Example 2 - 

- Input => String s1 = "abcd" , String s2 = "dbac"

- Output => It's an Anagram i.e both the strings have same letters just arranged differently.

Example 3 -

- Input => String s1 = "Github" , String s2 = "Git"

- Output => It's not an Anagram i.e both the strings have different letters.
